## ABOUT

My name is Rimjhim Saxena (Pronounced : *Rim-Jim Sax-Ã©na*)

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [University of Colorado, Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/economics/). I like working at the intersection of Climate + Labor + Development, preferably with a good coffee.

Before starting graduate school, I worked as a Research Assistant at [Center for the Advanced Study of India, University of Pennsylvania](https://casi.sas.upenn.edu). I hold a Masters degree in Economics from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/econ/), MBA in Finance and Bachelors in Industrial Engineering from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, India (Top 10 engineering schools in India, 997 globally).
