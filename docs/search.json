    "text": "Working Papers\n Structural Transformation and Climate Change in India\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n Climate change is expected to have heterogeneous effects on economic sectors and across geographic locations. India is primarily an agrarian country with second largest population, seventh largest in area and seventh highest risk to climate change in the world. Estimating heterogeneous effect of Climate change across sectors and genders directly impacts policy making for a large population. I develop a spatial equilibrium model emphasizing the link between climate change, “food problem” and structural transformation and empirically estimate the impact of temperature on labor shares by sector, gender, and migration status. I find that labor share in agriculture increases at extremes of temperature, inhibiting structural transformation. “The food problem” gets exacerbated due to climate change pushing labor into agriculture. While trade can solve this problem, I find that inefficiencies in Indian agricultural market keeps trade from becoming a helpful tool and causes disadaptation to climate change. I also find that women in India do not have access to migration as an adaptation tool but they are able to adapt to heat through sectoral reallocation.\n\n\n\n\n\n Climate Change, Cricket, and Collaboration: Estimating Labor Productivity Under Temperature Shocks\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n The impact of temperature, particularly temperature shocks on, individual worker productivity within collaborative and adversarial setting remains an unexplored area of literature. This paper leverages the sport of international cricket’s team oriented dynamics to study the effect of temperature and temperature shocks on individual’s response to collaboration and competition. I find that individual labor productivity exhibits an inverted U-shaped relationship with contemporaneous temperature and workers demonstrate adaptability to temperature shocks by increasing collaboration with teammates."
