    "text": "Structural Transformation and Climate Change in India\n\n\n\n Climate change is expected to have heterogeneous effect on economic sectors across geographic locations. India is the seventh largest country in area with second largest population in the world, and carries the seventh highest risk to climate change in the world. Assessing potential decisions of economic agents when adapting to climate change is challenging but crucial for policy making. In this paper, I develop a dynamic spatial equilibrium model to quantify economic agents’ response to climate change and estimate its effect on labor reallocation, population displacement, and productivity change for firms. By simulating the model for future policy scenarios, I estimate the aggregate distributional impacts of climate change in terms of trade off between adaptation through sectoral shift and migration."
