India is the seventh largest country in area with second largest population in the world, and carries the seventh highest risk to climate change in the world. Assessing potential decisions of economic agents when adapting to climate change is challenging but crucial for policy making. In this paper, I develop a dynamic spatial equilibrium model to quantify economic agents' response to climate change and estimate its effect on labor reallocation, population displacement, and productivity change for firms. By simulating the model for future policy scenarios, I estimate the aggregate distributional impacts of climate change in terms of trade off between adaptation through sectoral shift and migration.</font>\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n![](images/aby-zachariah-GsTLiE1xrUg-unsplash.jpg){width=\"800\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Works in progress\n\n-   Climate Change, Cricket and Caution\n\n-   Heat begets pollution : Estimating the heat-pollution response function in India (with [Beia Spiller](https://www.rff.org/people/beia-spiller/))\n\n-   Climate Change and Mechanization of Agriculture in India (with Bhavya Srivastava)\n\n## Book Chapters\n\n-   [Understanding the Gender Gap in Education and Employment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/colossus/education-understanding-the-gender-gap-in-education-and-employment/163763A3D320223894A3E7F31DFD46D4) Chapter in *Colossus : The anatomy of Delhi ,* edited by Sanjoy Chakravorty and Neelanjan Sircar.
