<font size = 2, color ="#717d7e"> Climate change is expected to have heterogeneous effect on economic sectors and across geographic locations. India is the seventh largest country in area with second largest population and seventh highest risk to climate change in the world, estimating this heterogenous effect directly impacts policy making for a large population. This paper estimates the effect of climate change on sectoral reallocation on economic sectors across India. I develop a multi region dynamic spatial equilibrium model in which economic sectors face region and sector specific climate shock. Locations are linked to each other through trade and migration. Firms face productivity shocks. Workers face a forward looking dynamic decision of where to live and work - they have a choice of adaptation through sectoral reallocation in the same location or migration. I estimate the preference between sectoral reallocation and migration in every region - sector. I also incorporate non homothetic preferences for consumption to emphasize the trade off between food problem and trade in India as the food problem is expected to get accentuated by climate change.</font>
